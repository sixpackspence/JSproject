        <p class="childP">This is a small tutorial on how to build A rocket mass heater.</br>
            There will be words and pictures from the project I did at home with friends
            and family and things I learned along the way</br>

            <br>This system is in a 20 x 15 ft greenhouse with with a sloped ceiling with an average height of
            about 10 feet. 200 dollars worth of wood keeps the greenhouse warm all winter long (about 4 months).
            Compared to a traditional fireplace that is about 1/10 the wood you would use, and it keeps all the
            heat in its system instead of just releasing it straight through the chimney like a traditional
            fireplace<br>

            </br> All the clay I used in this tutorial was hand dug in the desert,
            If anyone has any questions on where they can find clay to dig themselves feel free
            to ask. Things that need to be purchased are, sand (unless you can find your own in nature)
            , metal drum (which you can find for free alot of the time) and the chimney/exhaust piping
            which you can make out of clay if you feel up to it. </br>
            </br>
            To the right are rough
            pics of what it looks like while being assembled. Pretty much all earthen material can be used
            stone, sand, rocks, dirt, etc. of course you can add stones, tile, any non flammable
            material you can think of to design the outside of yours, to pretty it up the way you like. <br>
            <br>
            Slight bits of info will be added to the bottom of each photo, the point of this write up is to give
            you a general idea of how this works and give you knowledge on how well this works as a heat source,
            or just something to show off.
